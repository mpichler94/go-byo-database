# Build your own Database in Go

In this repository, a database is implemented from scratch in Go.
This database is not intended to be used in any meaningful way.
Its sole reason for existence is to learn about databases and the Go programming language.

The implementation follows the puzzles from the [Trial of Code](https://trialofcode.org/database/) project.
